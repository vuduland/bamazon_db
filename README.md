### This is a mock online storefront with that utilizes a MySql database to store stock information. The user is able to interact (input data) and modify data (purchase items) using the terminal with Node.js and the Inquirer package.

## Use

### The app is used by downloading the files onto the user's PC. Node.js is required in order for it's use, which can be downloaded <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">**here**</a>.

### Once the user has both of these, they need to enter their command prompt inside the directory (_bamazon_db_) where the program is saved. The user can then find information by entering commands in the form of:

| Node Reference | Script Reference   | Item ID       | Qty     |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------------- | ------- |
| node           | bamazonCustomer.js | Integers 1-10 | Integer |
